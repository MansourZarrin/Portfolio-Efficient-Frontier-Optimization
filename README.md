# Portfolio-Efficient-Frontier-Optimization

A Portfolio Optimization model that employs Monte
Carlo Simulation and Quadratic Programming to determine the optimal
asset allocation for a given set of financial instruments. The model is
implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as 'NumPy',
'SciPy', and 'yfinance'. The model successfully identifies the
optimal portfolio by maximizing the Sharpe Ratio, providing valuable
insights for investment strategies. The efficient frontier is also
plotted to visualize the set of optimal portfolios.

# Parameters and Variables

-   **Tickers**: List of asset symbols.
-   **Start_Date, End_Date**: Time range for historical data.
-   **Historical_Returns**: Adjusted close prices.
-   **Log_Ret**: Logarithmic returns.
-   **Weights**: Asset allocation in the portfolio.
